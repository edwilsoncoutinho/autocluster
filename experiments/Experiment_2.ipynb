    "\n",
    "In theory, metalearning should improve many aspects of machine learning.\n",
    "For the application of clustering, where does this benefit lie? \n",

    "- Which features should we use to preform metalearning?\n",
    "- What linear combination of the features should we take \n",
    "There is also the question of which specific subset of metalearning features should we take into account, as well as the method in which we calculate the distance between these features.\n",
